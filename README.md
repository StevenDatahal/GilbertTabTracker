Steven's code for the Gilbert Tab Tracker.

What is the Gilbert Tab Tracker?
A program which caps the students at the Gilbert school to a maxmium of X (x=8 atm) tabs so they don't crash GoGaurdian or another process since the devices never seem to auto update which leads to resources not being used effectively.
